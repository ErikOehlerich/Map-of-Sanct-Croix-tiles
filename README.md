Hello

Welcome to Sanct Scroix Anno 1799
This is  a project aimed at trying to understand how Sanct Croix worked as a slave society in the year 1799.

Link to the GitHub page with the map:
https://erikoehlerich.github.io/Map-of-Sanct-Croix-tiles/

The map originates from the Royal Danish Library:
http://www5.kb.dk/maps/kortsa/2012/jul/kortatlas/object65447/da/

This map can not be used for comercial use without prior written confirmation, because I have georeferenced the map and exported it so it's able to be used as a plugin for websites, if it's for reasearch, teaching or education it is allowed as long as credit is given.

It should either be left as Erik Luis Lanuza Oehlerich or just E.L.L.O


Best regards E.L.LO
